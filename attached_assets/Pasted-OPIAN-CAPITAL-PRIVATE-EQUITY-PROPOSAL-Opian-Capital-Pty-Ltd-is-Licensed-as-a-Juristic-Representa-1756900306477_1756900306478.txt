Dear Mrs Charmaine Erasmus
We thank you for your interest in our Private Equity Proposal
1. Executive Summary
This proposal outlines a strategic private equity (PE) investment strategy designed
to grow an initial capital of R150,000 by 72% (R258,000 total) over a 3-year horizon.
By leveraging high-growth private equity opportunities in carefully selected
industries, we aim to maximize returns while mitigating risks through diversification
and expert fund management.
Key Highlights:
 Target Return: 72% growth (R108,000 profit) in 3 years (~19.8% annualised
return).
 Investment Strategy: Focus on growth equity in high-potential sectors.
 Risk Management: Portfolio diversification, and active management.
 Exit Strategy: Share buybacks, IPOs, or secondary buyouts after 3 years.
2. Investment Opportunity & Market Outlook
Private equity has historically outperformed public markets, delivering 12-25%+
annual returns in emerging markets like South Africa and BRICS. Key sectors with
strong growth potential include:
Technology & FinTech (Digital payments, SaaS, AI Related business)
Consumer Goods & Retail (E-commerce, premium brands, Rewards, Lifestyle products)
Healthcare & Biotechnology (Telemedicine, generics manufacturing)
Renewable Energy (Solar, battery storage)
By investing in early stage but undervalued businesses with strong cash flow, IP and
scalability, we position the portfolio for accelerated growth.
